        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

        <h1>My Resume</h1>
        <p>Ao contrário do que se acredita, Lorem Ipsum não é simplesmente um texto randômico. Com mais de 2000 anos, suas raízes podem ser encontradas em uma obra de literatura latina clássica datada de 45 AC. Richard McClintock, um professor de latim do Hampden-Sydney College na Virginia, pesquisou uma das mais obscuras palavras em latim, consectetur, oriunda de uma passagem de Lorem Ipsum, e, procurando por entre citações da palavra na literatura clássica, descobriu a sua indubitável origem. Lorem Ipsum vem das seções 1.10.32 e 1.10.33 do "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (Os Extremos do Bem e do Mal), de Cícero, escrito em 45 AC. Este livro é um tratado de teoria da ética muito popular na época da Renascença. A primeira linha de Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet..." vem de uma linha na seção 1.10.32.</p>
        <p>O trecho padrão original de Lorem Ipsum, usado desde o século XVI, está reproduzido abaixo para os interessados. Seções 1.10.32 e 1.10.33 de "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" de Cicero também foram reproduzidas abaixo em sua forma exata original, acompanhada das versões para o inglês da tradução feita por H. Rackham em 1914.</p>
